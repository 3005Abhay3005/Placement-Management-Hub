## About

PlacementHub is a Campus Placement and Internship Management System designed to streamline the recruitment process for educational institutes. The application aims to connect students, recruiters, and the institute placement cell through role-based portals, eligibility-based opportunities, application tracking, and recruiter verification workflows.
